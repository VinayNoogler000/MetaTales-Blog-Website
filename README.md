# METATALES

MetaTales is a blog website where users can see and read blogs of other users, & create and edit their own blogs. It also has signup and login functionality which is compulsory for user who wants to use this platform.

This website is my first ever Mega Project using React, which is being built as a Software-Solution, that actually solves a problem.

Thanks a lot to my mentor [Sir. Hitesh Choudhary](https://github.com/hiteshchoudhary) for guiding me throughout the project (idea to deployment), giving me assignments to strengthen my fundamentals, and helping me in solving my doubts.

## Tech Stack:
1. **Frontend:** ReactJS, Redux Toolkit, Tailwind CSS
2. **Backend:** Appwrite (No-Code Backend)
3. **External Libraries/APIs:** [TinyMCE (Rich Text Editor)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tinymce/tinymce-react), [HTML React Parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/html-react-parser), [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/get-started)
4. **Deployment:** Vercel (Frontend), Appwrite Cloud (Backend)

## Todos:
1. Add state and reducers for "post" and "image" services by using Redux Toolkit.
